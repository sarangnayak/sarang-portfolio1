    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy engaging in a variety of activities that stimulate both my body and mind. Below are some of my favorite hobbies:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cricket:</strong> A sport that allows me to stay active, develop teamwork skills, and enhance my focus and strategy.</li>
        <li><strong>Badminton:</strong> Another sport that keeps me engaged physically while improving my hand-eye coordination and agility.</li>
        <li><strong>Chess:</strong> The intellectual challenge of chess sharpens my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Rubik's Cube:</strong> A puzzle that tests my patience, logic, and problem-solving skills.</li>

    <p>These activities not only provide a balanced blend of physical and mental stimulation but also help me develop perseverance, concentration, and strategic thinking. These qualities extend into both my personal and professional life.</p>
